# Conway's game of life

After listening to Software Unscripted podcast, Richald Feldman mentions that back in the days in one of the
Elm hack night sessions, someone, decided to create the game of life in Elm.

I realised I never did this challenge, so I did it myself to refresh things such as Random, Time and dealing with cells in
Elm-CSS.
